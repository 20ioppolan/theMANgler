# Deploy

Grand Unifed Deploy (GUD) repo.


## How to Use

The deploy repository contains everything needed to deploy a red team competition with Ansible.

In short:

1. Deploy all tools to the test team
2. Reboot all boxes
3. Observe tool functionality (backdoors, persistence, etc)
4. Observe OS functionality (updates, GUIs, services, logins, etc)
5. Wait awhile to ensure stress testing is done to prevent issues that only present under high load
6. Deploy to other boxes, reboot boxes, and observe same OS and functionality tests
7. Get some sleep!
